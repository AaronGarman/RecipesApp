HIGH
- Recheck code all - comments in + out, more extensions + functions

MEDIUM
- Keyboard down - after type, tap off, enter (newline for dirs), keyboard up methods or scrollview or push up screen, for no block typing too? End editing like IBAction in ios102 lab 2? Constraints on box width to keep text format? for dirs, enter to end?

LOW
- Parse Database - create, query, update, delete - worst case just do user defaults - steps 6 & 7 for db, fig all CRUD - gpt see format? pull each time or update own array?

SMALL

----------

OPTIONAL

GENERAL
- comments in + out
- print out data? print v logs?
- org code at end
- folders for files? sep folders tableview cells?
- no need reload data in view will appear? would be for after add? any reload change once db?
- gpt ask on comments stuff, like if need something
- load in db + mock directions
- maybe refactor to just item?
- more folders for diff types of stuff? sign in, cells, etc

no use my default image, use pre built one?
pics own folder on github? gpt ask?
refactor buttons code to funcs rather than in button, also all funcs private?
also do funcs in view did load over code there - if in func or out
vars at top
periods in alerts
more stuff as funcs
vars before ibactions?
private funcs all?

full files ask gpt?

top to bottom: outlets, member data, lifecycle, actions, methods - here + yahtzee

// maybe refactor shopItem to just item?
// clean up db files - id take out since no use w/ parse, parse id maps to id
// func to load db? change mock data any? put user.current here or on mock data? prob here in shop vc?

// extra nav controllers for modal formatting w/ top buttons? see gpt?

more folders for stuff? move pics to folders on github too

comments all files after finish

Org, test, comments - push indiv files
Finish 2 files first + do delete - test all
Re-query only, or ever manual update?
use MARK for any ext or section labels?

ever do a did set instead of always call reload data?






org here
more folders - cells, auth, etc, split by recipe/shopitem v no? also fig pictures github folder


// check error messages + parameters - on 2 shop item files, redundant any?
// query v 2 remove? only for animation + overhead of re-querying?


        /// query db here, also reload table view? query and remove parallel v just query each time?
        /// remove from db here
        
spacing on alert funcs?


maybe refactor errors into own class? just take params? maybe do static methods?
take top part off all files? like w/ name n date
