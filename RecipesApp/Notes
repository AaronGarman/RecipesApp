HIGH
- Recheck code all - comments in + out, more extensions + functions
- Look into taking out not number alert - just error check mins > 0?
- Match color directions text box add n details?

MEDIUM
- Keyboard down - after type, tap off, enter (newline for dirs), keyboard up methods or scrollview or push up screen, for no block typing too? End editing like IBAction in ios102 lab 2? Constraints on box width to keep text format? for dirs, enter to end?

LOW
- User auth
- Parse Database - create, query, update, delete - worst case just do user defaults

SMALL

----------

OPTIONAL

GENERAL
- comments in + out
- print out data? print v logs?
- org code at end
- folders for files? sep folders tableview cells?
- no need reload data in view will appear? would be for after add? any reload change once db?
- gpt ask on comments stuff, like if need something
- load in db + mock directions
- maybe refactor to just item?
- more folders for diff types of stuff? sign in, cells, etc



make UI full + constraints
test to see if works prints - sign up, sign in, sign out, persisted - on phone too
push



steps 1-4 check user auth - finish all auth before db save
skip step 5
steps 6 & 7 for db, fig all CRUD - gpt see format?
