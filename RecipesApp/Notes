HIGH
- try new cell card like panera one - how tap on cell n not highlight? Also nav link on cell v image or view? update pic github. do as view within it n do shadow or diff color?

MEDIUM
- recheck/org code all - comments in + out, more extensions + functions

LOW
- keyboard push up or scrollview to not block dirs input? Try scrollview + push up, only for dirs tho?

SMALL
- private funcs all? private set member data any?
- take top part off all files? like w/ name n date
- pics own folder on github? gpt ask?
- more folders for diff types of stuff? sign in, cells, etc. Split by recipe/shopitem v no?
- periods in alerts? Also capitalize all words v no? change wording any? say specific fields or just all fields? OK vs Ok? also need display errors descriptions in some v all? Use format from gpt camera one
- capitalize section comments? also use mark any?
- re-fig mock data vs just take out? image files instead?
- spacing on alert funcs?
- diff names in db func closures for recipe n shop item? like in the let w/ cases so not redundant

----------

GENERAL
- full files ask gpt?
- comments all files in + out
- more funcs + extensions?
- top to bottom: outlets, member data, lifecycle, actions, methods, extensions - use mark to divide sections? see pic 7/29
- print out data? print v logs? or take prints out?
- any log type errors need fix?
- check all end

OPTIONAL
- manage array + tableview separately than db so can do animations on add/edit + delete? over re-query
- how improve UI more?
- maybe refactor shopItem to just item?
- maybe refactor errors into own class? just take params? maybe do static methods?
- ever do a did set instead of always call reload data? would conflict w/ animations if do?
- default image own vs pre built one? prob own. also image as optional or not, default image save or no?
- load db func make? over mock? how do image file? put user.current on mock?
- check error messages + parameters - on 2 shop item files, redundant any?
- constraints on box width to keep text format? for dirs
